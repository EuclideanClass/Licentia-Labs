# Licentia Labs

"This project was started by a LoversLab member named Lust Licentia, who is currently missing. I am maintaining the mod in his stead until or unless he returns."

The person who wrote that has been missing for a while too, so I've temporarily taken over updating this mod. You can access their original Git [here](https://gitgud.io/John-the-Anabaptist/licentia-labs).

## Features

The mod is named primarily after the ability to craft serums (Licentia *Labs*), but there are various features:

- The ability to craft various serums to alter your pawns in various sexy ways, such as enlarging or shrinking genitalia. Using standard RJW crafting items, pawns can turn them into these serums and drink them for their various effects.
- The introduction of stretching and prolapsing mechanics to the basic RJW sex system. If a pawn with genitalia too large for another pawn have sex, then the pawn that is smaller might experience their orifices getting stretched out, damaged, or even prolapsed depending on how large the difference is.
- The introduction of cum inflation mechanics for pawns based on the cum output of the one doing the penetrating. A productive pawn can literally feed their entire colony through sex (oral, anal, or double penetration) at the cost of their own hunger. Too much inflation may not be good for colony productivity, however, as the entire colony might end up as cum balloons too bloated to work!
